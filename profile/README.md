# Spotty For Alice 
##  The Pain (not actual since 02.24.2022)
A user story: you use Spotify as the main music service on your smartphone and desktop but you also have a Yandex.Station with Alice smart helper. The pain is the lack of synchronization between playlists in two music services, that’s why you can’t listen to his freshest favorite music in your smart pod.
Spotty For Alice is a service for migrating music tracks from various music services (Spotify only) to Yandex.Music, which plays tracks by commands to Alice's voice assistant.
##  How it works? (Arhitecture)
You should start Telegram bot where you should autorize to Spotify (via OAuth 2.0) and Yandex.Music (sorry, but enter login and password)...
##  Do you have better ideas?
